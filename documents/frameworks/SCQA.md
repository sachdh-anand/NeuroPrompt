## Description

The SCQA (Situation, Complication, Question, Answer) framework is a powerful structured approach for problem-solving prompts. It helps establish clear context, identify the core problem, pose the specific question, and guide the desired answer format.

## Structure

- **Situation:** Establish the current situation or context
- **Complication:** Identify the complication, challenge, or problem
- **Question:** Formulate the key question that needs to be addressed
- **Answer:** Guide towards the desired answer or output format

## Best For

- Problem-solving scenarios
- Business analysis tasks
- Decision-making processes
- Root cause analysis
- Consulting-style requests
- Troubleshooting scenarios

## Example

**Situation:** An e-commerce website has maintained steady traffic of approximately 100,000 visitors per month for the past year, with a consistent conversion rate of 3.2%.

**Complication:** In the past month, despite traffic remaining constant, the conversion rate has dropped to 2.4%, representing a 25% decrease in actual sales and revenue.

**Question:** What are the most likely causes for this sudden decrease in conversion rate, and what specific actions can the company take to diagnose and address the problem?

**Answer:** Provide a comprehensive analysis that includes:
1. The top 5 most probable causes for the conversion drop, ranked by likelihood
2. Specific diagnostic steps to confirm each potential cause
3. Actionable recommendations for addressing each confirmed issue
4. A prioritized implementation plan with estimated impact for each solution
5. Key metrics to monitor during remediation
