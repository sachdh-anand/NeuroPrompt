# ReAct Framework

Updated: 2025-03-10

## Description

The ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) framework is designed for complex problem-solving that requires step-by-step reasoning. It encourages the AI to break down problems, think through each component, and build solutions progressively through a systematic thought process.

## Structure

- **Thought:** Step-by-step reasoning about the problem
- **Action:** Define what action to take based on reasoning
- **Observation:** Note what is observed from the action
- **Next Thought/Action:** Continue the reasoning process

## Best For

- Complex reasoning tasks
- Multi-step problems
- Mathematical or logical challenges
- Sequential decision-making
- Algorithmic problem solving
- Tasks requiring careful analysis

## Example

**Problem:** A company needs to optimize their delivery routes for 5 trucks serving 25 locations across the city. What approach should they take?

**Thought:** This is a vehicle routing problem (VRP), a variation of the traveling salesman problem but with multiple vehicles. I need to consider the constraints and available algorithms.

**Action:** First, I'll identify the key constraints in this problem:
- 5 trucks (fixed)
- 25 locations to visit
- Need to determine: Which truck visits which locations, and in what order?
- Optimization goal is likely minimizing total distance/time

**Observation:** This is a classic NP-hard problem that can't be solved optimally for large instances in reasonable time. For 25 locations, we need a heuristic approach rather than trying all possible combinations.

**Thought:** We should consider practical algorithms that provide good (though not necessarily optimal) solutions quickly.

**Action:** I'll evaluate possible algorithmic approaches:
1. Clarke-Wright savings algorithm
2. Nearest neighbor heuristic with clustering
3. Modern metaheuristics like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms
4. Using existing VRP solver libraries

**Observation:** Of these options, the Clarke-Wright savings algorithm offers a good balance of solution quality and implementation simplicity.

**Thought:** Now I need to outline how to implement this approach.

**Action:** Here's the implementation approach:
1. Calculate the distance matrix between all 25 locations
2. Start with routes connecting each location directly to the depot
3. Calculate potential "savings" for combining routes
4. Iteratively merge routes based on highest savings until no further improvement
5. Assign the resulting routes to the 5 trucks

**Final Answer:** I recommend using the Clarke-Wright savings algorithm to solve this vehicle routing problem. The implementation would involve calculating a complete distance matrix, then iteratively combining routes based on calculated savings until you have 5 efficient routes, one for each truck. This approach typically achieves solutions within 10% of optimal while being computationally efficient. For implementation, the Python OR-Tools library has built-in solvers for this exact problem that would be even more effective than a manual implementation.
