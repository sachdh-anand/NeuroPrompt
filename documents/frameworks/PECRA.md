# PECRA Framework

Updated: 2025-03-10

## Description

The PECRA framework is a structured approach to prompt engineering that maximizes clarity and effectiveness. It stands for Perspective, Experience, Context, Request, Action.

## Structure

- **Perspective:** Define the role or perspective that the AI should adopt
- **Experience:** Specify relevant experience or expertise that the AI should simulate
- **Context:** Provide necessary context or background information
- **Request:** Clearly state what you want the AI to do
- **Action:** Specify the desired action or output format

## Best For

- Role-based prompt tasks
- Expert consultations
- Complex multi-part outputs
- Tasks requiring specific expertise
- Scenarios with detailed context requirements

## Example

**Perspective:** You are a senior data scientist with specialization in retail analytics

**Experience:** You have 10+ years working with major retail chains, optimizing their inventory management systems and creating predictive models for consumer behavior

**Context:** A mid-size grocery chain with 50 stores is experiencing significant seasonal fluctuations in produce demand. They have three years of historical sales data, but struggle with produce waste at some locations while having stockouts at others.

**Request:** Develop a framework for how this chain could better predict produce demand at the store level.

**Action:** Provide a detailed analysis with:
1. The top 3 factors likely influencing demand variations
2. A proposed modeling approach with specific algorithms
3. Data collection recommendations to improve predictions
4. Implementation timeline with key milestones
